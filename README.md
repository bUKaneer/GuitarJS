GuitarJS
========

A simple Javascript Guitar Object with Luthier extension allowing rendering and tone output via Web Audio API.

No libraries are used - its all native Javascript.

Use and/or modify as you see fit it's GPLv3 - Free Software baby, yeah!

I'd love to here some feedback so please do drop me a line on Twitter @bUKaneer.

As well as colourising same notes, luthier will now paint a frequency map!

Fully supported using the latest Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Opera

Partial support in IE11, guitar.js is fine, luthier will draw but there is no WebAudioApi support - perhaps IE12???

Not Supported at all in IE<11
