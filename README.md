GuitarJS
========

A simple Javascript Guitar Object with Luthier extension allowing rendering and tone output via Web Audio API.

No libraries are used - its all native Javascript.

Use and/or modify as you see fit it's GPLv3 - Free Software baby, yeah!

I'd love to here some feedback so please do drop me a line on Twitter @bUKaneer.
